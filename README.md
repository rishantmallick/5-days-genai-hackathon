# 5-days-genai-hackathon
here in this course, i created a chatbot called baristabot which basically takes order for a coffee shop. i also fine tuned a model.
Then I developed a RAG, i also created indices by testing various methods of semantic similarity like naive_indices, scann, 
and also prompting methods and also tested various nlp methods like word2vec, tf-idf etc.
Also i performed google ground search
